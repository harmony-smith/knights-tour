# knights-tour
A knight's tour is when the knight traverses each space on the board once. How many different paths can the knight take?

This program calculates the number of possible paths the knight can take to tour the board (assuming the knight starts at top left) when given the length of the board's side.
(The smallest board that the knight can tour is 5x5)
